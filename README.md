# ChooseYourSchool
Hi everyone!! My name is Khoi and I am currently an international student in the US. 
I have a great compassion for computer science and I want to spread this compassion to everyone. That sparks up an idea for me to create this website, with an intention to help coding lovers learn about the universities and colleges in the US. Good news is that I have put in information of over 50 universities that are the top in Computer Science major in the US. 
I will also consider putting in universities from other countries including Asia and Europe as well. 
Also, I have made an additional quiz about colleges and universities in the US for you guys to test out your knowledge as well. I would like to give credit for the U.S News and World Reports, Niche, CollegeVine, and Edurank for the precious information that are available to me when I was making the website. That helps me a lot!
That is probably everything about my website and I hope that every coders will find these information useful. I hope that y'all will get into your dream school. Thanks a lot!!!
